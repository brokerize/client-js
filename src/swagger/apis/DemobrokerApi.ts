Also, both fields are limited to market buy orders     - exchange_with_unlimited_tp_sl: `takeProfitStopLoss.exclusive` is `false`, so that both tp and sl may be set, for both sell and buy orders and both support orderModels     - exchange_without_tp_sl: `takeProfitStopLoss` is not set, so that no tp/sl can be set   - orders stay open forever   - the order size can be changed (`allowsChangeSize=true`) - ISIN US5529531015 (MGM Resorts International)   - one exchange with market and limit orders   - orders are executed immediately   - short selling is allowed, so `availableOrderIntents` as well as `availableOrderIntentsToken` is set. \"sell to open\" and \"buy to close\" can be tested here. - ISIN XAU (Gold)   - only quote trading is allowed   - depending on the selected portfolio, it is possible to select a cash account (e.g. EUR or USD) to trade with   - users can chose between specifying the order size in the cash currency or in grams   - quotes have the `totalAmount` field set - `CryptoPair` ADA-USD (Cardano - US Dollar)   - \'quote\', \'market\', \'limit\' order models are available   - One of the created demobroker portfolios does not have an USD cash account. For this portfolio an error will appear upon opening the order form   - users can chose between specifying the order size in the cash currency (USD) or in ADA   - validity types for limit orders are [\'IOC\', \'GTDT\']. With \'GTDT\' the user can specify a date AND time at which his order should be executed   - the size input decimal places are limited per sizeUnit. For USD it\'s 2 and for ADA it is 4 decimal places    - the orders will be canceled after 3 seconds - all other orders will be canceled after 3 seconds  Cost estimations for `buy` and `sell` return a different set of fields. This can be used to test proper UI behavior when fields are set or unavailable.  Behavior of `PortfolioQuotes` in the demo broker: - portfolio 1 starts with 100.000€ cash. portfolio 2 has two cash accounts, one starts with 100.000€, one with 100.000$. - when cash account values are summed up, we just assume an exchange rate of 1:1 - each open buy order reserves 10€ cash from the availableCash - profit loss of the portfolio is the sum of the position\'s profit loss - if a EUR cashAccount has the value 0,00€, its `hideInOverviews` property is set to true. This can be used to test the frontend\'s behavior when a cash account is hidden.
